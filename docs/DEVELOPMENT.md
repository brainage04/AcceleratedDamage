# Development

Use Java 25. The project has common sources and Fabric and NeoForge loader modules. `settings.gradle` uses the sibling MinecraftModConventions checkout when present; otherwise Gradle resolves the version pinned in `gradle.properties`.

## Build and tests

In Thomas's Minecraft workspace, check `heavy status` and run Gradle through `heavy`:

```shell
heavy status
heavy --mem 6G --label accelerateddamage-tests -- ./gradlew --no-daemon --no-parallel --max-workers=2 build runAllGameTests --continue
```

`runAllGameTests` includes Fabric and NeoForge server GameTests and the Fabric client GameTest. Shared server scenarios live in `common/src/gametest` and are registered by each loader. Client scenarios connect a vanilla client to a dedicated modded server and use keyboard input for melee and projectile attacks.

## Client recordings

The conventions recorder needs Xvfb, xdpyinfo, pactl and ffmpeg with X11 capture and PulseAudio input support. It creates a private display and audio sink; do not use the desktop's default sink.

```shell
heavy status
GTR_RECORDING_PROFILE=showcase heavy --mem 6G --label accelerateddamage-recording -- ./gradlew --no-daemon :fabric:recordClientGameTest
```

Recordings and their JSON metadata are written to `build/recordings`. The showcase covers vanilla damage immunity, rapid melee attacks, accelerated environmental effects, healing and drying, and one-tick bow, crossbow and trident attacks.
